Usage:

`./listProducedBlocks epochNumber producerAddress`

Description:

Searches all blocks for a specific epoch number, and prints those blocks expected to be produced by a specific block producer highlighting if it missed the block or did actually produce it.

Limitations:

Please notice that if any block is missed in the epoch **before** the first produced block, I have no way to tell the height of such missed blocks, because I found no way to know what is the sequence of delegates during production for an epoch, but I can predict the next expected block height for a producer to produce once it has produced at least one block (because anyway the sequence repeats itself along the whole epoch) 

Example:

Extract all blocks from epoch 16293 that should have been produced by io1tfke5nfwryte6nultpmqefadgm0dsahm2gm63k and highlights missed ones.

```
./listProducedBlocks 16293 io1tfke5nfwryte6nultpmqefadgm0dsahm2gm63k
